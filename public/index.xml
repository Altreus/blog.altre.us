      <description>The use and misuse of query strings It is extremely common to see the misuse of query strings like this:
/addresses?address_id=1234  Considering our options for how to interpret URLs, what we&amp;rsquo;re seeing here is a resource called addresses. This resource can be used to pull out an address by its ID, using the query string.
But hang on, what we know about resources means that the address itself is a resource; it&amp;rsquo;s the address that has the identifier, after all.</description>

      <description>This post is the first in a series on web fundamentals. The series was inspired by a perpetual amazement at the amateurish output of professionals working at large internet companies.
In this post we will look at the URL, which we have all seen in our browsers&amp;rsquo; address bars, and plastered all over social media. Hopefully, by the end of the article, you will understand the structure of the URL, and have enough of an understanding to be rightly appalled at some of the ones you see in the future.</description>
